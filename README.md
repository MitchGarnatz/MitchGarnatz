- Hi, I’m @MitchGarnatz
- I’m currently an Undergraduate Senior at the University of St. Thomas
- Graduating in May of 2023
- Below is my reflection for CISC 480 Senior Capstone

- Problem of interest: 
- Sustainability: Engery consumption & Gun Violence     

- Connection to the common good:  
- Morally responsible leaders, Think Critically, act wisely, work skillfully

- UnitTests:            Energy consumption, working for fastest runtime
- MIPS bubbleSort:      Energy consumption, assembly is works close to processor
- GunViolence data:     Citizen awareness, geographic location affiliation
- Database Creation:    Domain-specific point of view, how non-cs student would use
- Position Paper:       Work outside cirriculum
