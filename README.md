- Hi, I’m @MitchGarnatz
- I’m currently an Undergraduate Senior at the University of St. Thomas
- Graduating in May of 2023
- Below is my reflection for CISC 480 Senior Capstone

- Problem of interest: 
- Sustainability: Engery consumption & Gun Violence     

- Connection to the common good:  
- Morally responsible leaders, Think Critically, act wisely, work skillfully

- UnitTests:            Energy consumption, working for fastest runtime
- MIPS bubbleSort:      Energy consumption, assembly is works close to processor
- GunViolence data:     Citizen awareness, geographic location affiliation
- Database Creation:    Domain-specific point of view, how non-cs student would use
- Position Paper:       Work outside cirriculum tying science and christianity

Upon entering the computer science program at The University of St. Thomas, I had little to no knowledge of what coding really was. As I enter my final week of enrollment in CISC 480 Senior Capstone, I realize there is much I have learned regarding the application of computer science to the world. It is one thing to know the basics on how to code, but to know how to code and apply it to a functioning model is a skill I am thankful to have gained. There are many assignments/projects that have guided myself in becoming a more skilled developer, and I will touch on the most significant in my time at St. Thomas. These projects have helped me to hone my skills through the University's mission in being a morally responsible leader, thinking critically through problem solving, and acting with wisdom when approached with unfamiliar situations. As well as practicing these values, much of the coursework we have dealt with ties directly to the current issue sustainability. 

Firstly, a project that I worked on in CISC 480 Senior Capstsone involved creating integration tests for a server called Spock. More detailed information on the project can be found here https://github.com/MitchGarnatz/SpockUnitTesting. Briefly, this project consisted of writing tests in java to analyze whether certain controller classes were working for the server. Much critical thinking was involved in debugging code, working to meet certain cases, and to ensure that objects were being correctly added and removed from the database. This piece of work also connects directly to the sustainability of energy. A key goal on the backend side of processes is to ensure runtime is as fast as possible. The tests I created in this project were quite large, so making sure the code was as efficient as possible helps in the greater scheme towards enegy conservation.
